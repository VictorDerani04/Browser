A small web search. In the Browser class you can really see the practice with stacks. The commands are "home",
"next", "prev", "reload", "back", "forward", "links", "[number]", "exit" or "quit", and "help".
"home" brings the user back to the home page. "next" tells the browser that they want the next frame.
"prev" tells the browser that they want the previous frame. "reload" reloads the current page from the beginning.
"back" returns to the previous page. "forward" returns to the next page in the forward page stack.
"links" prints a list of links on the current page and their associated numbers.
"[number]" it is for when the user types a number and it is within the appropriate range for the
links array, the browser should navigate to the corresponding new page. "help" prints a list of all the commands and what they do.
"exit" or "quit" stop the process and exit the browser.
